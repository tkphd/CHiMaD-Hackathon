This directory contains MMSP code for phase field simulation of spinodal
decomposition, using the Cahn-Hilliard equations with a parametrized free
energy density. Rather than an explicit forward Euler discretization, this
program implements the semi-implicit discretization produced by convex
splitting the free energy functional.
